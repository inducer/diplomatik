Hi Andreas,

That's right -- and there are no tarballs or official releases either!

Airspeed is, of course, Open Source, but no licence has yet been chosen.
I'll check with my co-author Chris today, but I think you can safely assume 
that the licence will be either LGPL or BSD-style, ie. very liberal.

Best wishes,

-Steve
